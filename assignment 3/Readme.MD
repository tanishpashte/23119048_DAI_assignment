## Summary
This project aims to predict restaurant tip amounts using different machine learning models. First, I preprocessed the data by handling categorical variables and scaling numerical features. Then, I implemented and tested several regression models, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). I evaluated these models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) scores. Lasso Regression and SVR performed best, striking a good balance between reducing prediction errors and explaining data variance. I also created visualizations, like scatter plots, to explore relationships between variables, especially the link between total bill amount and tip.

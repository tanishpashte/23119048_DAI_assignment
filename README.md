We analyzed a heart disease dataset, starting by cleaning the data and examining each variable individually. Our findings revealed a higher number of males in the dataset, a significant portion of patients experiencing no chest pain symptoms, and most patients having normal blood sugar levels. 

We then investigated how different factors, such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure, related to heart disease. We found that older patients and those with higher cholesterol levels were more likely to have heart disease. This analysis provided valuable insights into important risk factors.

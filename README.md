I analyzed a heart disease dataset, starting by cleaning the data and examining each variable individually. Findings revealed a higher number of males in the dataset, a significant portion of patients experiencing no chest pain symptoms, and most patients having normal blood sugar levels. 

I then investigated how different factors, such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure, related to heart disease. I found that older patients and those with higher cholesterol levels were more likely to have heart disease. This analysis provided valuable insights into important risk factors.
